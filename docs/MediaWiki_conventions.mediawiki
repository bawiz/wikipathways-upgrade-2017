== MediaWiki conventions ==

=== Don't assign by reference ===
The following assignment style is from ancient php and should not be used:
<strike><source lang="php">
$dbr =& wfGetDB( DB_SLAVE );
</source></strike>
The ampersand isn't necessary:
<source lang="php">
$dbr = wfGetDB( DB_SLAVE );
</source>

=== Use $dbr->select() ===
Don't create a select statement by hand and then feed them to <code>query()</code> like the following:
<strike><source lang="php">
		$query = "SELECT page_title FROM page
				WHERE page_namespace = $ns AND page_is_redirect = 0";
		$res = $dbr->query( $query, __METHOD__ );
</source></strike>

Instead, use select so that escaping, etc. are automatically handled:
<source lang="php">
		$res = $dbr->select(
			'page', 'page_title',
			[ 'page_namespace' => $ns, 'page_is_redirect' => 0 ], __METHOD__
		);
</source>

=== Iterating over a database result ===
Don't use <code>while</code>:
<striike><source lang="php">
while ( $row = $dbr->fetchRow( $res ) ) {
    ...
}
</source></strike>
Instead, use the simpler <code>foreach</code>:
<source lang="php">
foreach ( $res as $row ) {
    ...
}
</source>
=== Freeing a DB result usually isn't necessary ===
If the DB result is used within the function, then when it falls out of scope, it will automatically be freed.

Usually, the following call is not needed:
<strike><source lang="php">
$dbr->freeResult( $res );
</source></strike>
